#he print() functionâ€™s end parameter specifies what is appended after the printed text (default "\n").
#  Using end=" " appends two spaces instead of a newline, 
# so the next print continues on the same line after two spaces

print("Hello!", end=" ")
print("How are you doing?", end=" ")
print("What's your 20?")

#useful in loops to print items on the same line
